# PartyApp

PartyApp is a simple node-based application which will allow you to setup party invites in no time. Send the link to the people that you want to invite and this should be all!

As a user I can:
1. Know the exact location of the party
2. Know about the dresscode, the plan, the food...
3. Know who else is going to be there and wether or not they accepted the invitation
4. Submit the perfect date for the party to take place in an external link (Doodle)
5. Get to see the full menu
6. Submit a form with my food option, attendance comfirmation and any other info I need to convay to the host.


You can find a deployed version of the project [HERE](https://partyapp-node.herokuapp.com/).
